%h2 What's Studygroup?

%p Learn programming. Study history. Practice French. Discuss business strategy. Get ready for a professional exam. Improve your blogging. Or creative writing. Or urban farming. Whatever you can come up with!

%p Yes, wine tasting.

%h4 Learning is more fun with other like-minded people.

%h3 Steps

%ol
  %li Set up a profile.

  %li See other people by their tags.
  %li Connect with people.

%h4 DIY learning environments and hangouts

%p Studygroups are completely self-organizing and self-generated. You can define the format you want.

%p Your "class" will probably have a fantastic student to faculty ratio at first. 1:1. You!

%p If you are working on learning something new, publish an event with a description that others can see and decide if they want to join.

%p Eventually, you can set up micro-to-small groups of people interested in the same topic, meeting up regularly to learn the material.

%p AKA classes!

%h3 Why?

%p College costs are like... WAY high.

%p Millions of educational resources are available online. You can access curriculums, tutorials, textbooks, videos, blogs and websites for free or minimal cost.

%p What's missing is the in-person environment with other learners. Most people will agree the value of a college class isn't just in the material you learn in the classroom. It's in interaction, connections and the network with likeminded people that you build during your education.

%p So build your own network!

%h3 Why did you make Studygroup?

%p I made Studygroup because I have a Sociology degree and now I build websites.
