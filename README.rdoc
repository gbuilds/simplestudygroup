This is the final project that I built following The Odin Project, see here:
http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project

I've added and changed a few things. Studygroup is a group learning application.
It will help people connect locally with small groups of people who are studying the same thing.

Using Postgresql, Devise, HAML, and attempting to write some basic tests.
